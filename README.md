# Junglier and Davier than JD1
Welcome to the jungle!!! We've got... a dissapointingly incomplete song lyric in the first line of a README. Also, I left that typo in this README so that some CS senior can come along and pad their Github resume, so send me a PR.

# Jungle Dave 2
This is Jungle Dave - a game about Canada's progressive nuclear weaponization.

You play as a **Canadian** flag that runs around the map picking up "nuke fragments". These fragments are both score, and weapons. You can fire a nuke at **Mexico's**, and **Mexico** will split off into new nuke fragments.

As you progress through the game, you unlock progressively devastating "streaks" (think: Call of Duty). Some of these streaks:

* A "flock" of **Americas** flys in, laying waste to anything they touch
* A **Great Britan**, which wanders around aimlessly destroying anything it touches.
* An **Australia** pops in and hits you, forcing you to flee to anywhere on the map but Australia.

There is no winning, only Zuul. 

# Tech Stack
Jungle Dave is written in React. The ultimate goal is to have Jungle Dave to exhibit the most progressive tech stack possible.

I assume that before this is all over, JD2 will use:

* ReasonML / React (rendering)
* Rust + WASM (collision detection)
* AWS EKS (devops)
